                <p>Web development in simple terms means developing a website for the internet.</p>
                <p>Various processes are involved when it comes to building a website and to get it up and running; like
                    coding, programming or designing etc. Web development particularly deals with the coding or the
                    programming side that enables a website to run and function properly.</p>
                <p>It mainly revolves around the non-design aspect of creating a website.</p>
                <p>If you are interested to <strong>study web development</strong>, you are at the right place! Together
                    we will discuss the reasons why web development is becoming such a sought after career choice and
                    why we think you have embarked on a right decision.</p>
                <p>The computer powered revolution has left every area of society untouched which leaves businesses both
                    big and small seeking to enter into the web arena. There is a surplus of opportunities for web
                    developers to dominate!</p>

                <h1>HTML Basics</h1>
                <p>HTML (<strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage)
                    is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be
                    structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
                    As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
                </p>
                <section>
                    <h2>So what is HTML?</h2>
                    <p>HTML is a <em>markup language</em> that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a
                        series of <strong><a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element">elements</a></strong>, which you use to
                        enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a
                        certain way. The enclosing <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tag">tags</a> can make a word or image
                        hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so
                        on. For example, take the following line of content:</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>
                    <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="/images/grumpy-cat-small.png" loading="lazy">
                    </p>
                    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case,
                            p), wrapped in opening and closing <strong>angle brackets</strong>. This states where the
                            element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                        <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it
                            includes a <em>forward slash</em> before the element name. This states where the element
                            ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the
                            standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
                        <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is
                            just text.</li>
                        <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together
                            comprise the element.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="/images/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" loading="lazy">
                    </p>
                    <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the
                        actual content. Here, <code>class</code> is the attribute <em>name</em> and
                        <code>editor-note</code> is the attribute <em>value</em>. The <code>class</code> attribute
                        allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any
                        other elements with the same <code>class</code> value) with style information and other things.
                    </p>
                    <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already
                            has one or more attributes).</li>
                        <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                        <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <div class="notecard note" id="sect1">
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of
                            the characters <code>"</code> <code>'</code> <code>`</code> <code>=</code> <code>&lt;</code>
                            <code>&gt;</code> ) can remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute
                            values, as it makes the code more consistent and understandable.

                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. <em>CSS basics</em> walks through
                    what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make
                    content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with

                    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
                    <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. <strong>CSS is a
                            style sheet language.</strong> CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For
                        example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:</p>
                    <p>Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above) into a new file. Save
                        the file as <code>style.css</code> in a directory named <code>styles</code>.</p>
                    <p>To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise,
                        the styling won't change the appearance of the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project,

                    <h3>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h3>
                    <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works :</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="/images/css-declaration-small.png">
                    </p>
                    <p>The whole structure is called a <strong>ruleset</strong>. (The term <em>ruleset</em> is often
                        referred to as just <em>rule</em>.) Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Selector</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s)
                                to be styled (in this example, <a
                                    href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a> elements). To
                                style a different element, change the selector.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Declaration</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>This is a single rule like <code>color: red;</code>. It specifies which of the
                                element's <strong>properties</strong> you want to style.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Properties</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example,
                                <code>color</code> is a property of the <a
                                    href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a> elements.) In
                                CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt id="property_value">Property value</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the <strong>property
                                    value</strong>. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given
                                property. (For example, there are many <code>color</code> values in addition to
                                <code>red</code>.)
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. (<code>{}</code>)
                        </li>
                        <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (<code>:</code>) to separate the property
                            from its value or values.</li>
                        <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (<code>;</code>) to separate each
                            declaration from the next one.</li>

                    JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in
                    games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with
                    dynamic styling; with animation, etc.
                    This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is
                    possible.

                    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is a powerful programming language
                        that can add interactivity to a website.
                        It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation,
                        and the Mozilla Corporation).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly.
                        With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics,
                        comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
                    </p>
                    <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety
                        of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality
                        with minimum effort. These include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (<a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/API">APIs</a>)
                            built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and
                            setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or
                            generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
                        <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other
                            content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
                        <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work
                            of building sites and applications.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to present the
                        details of how the core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You

                        features of the language. It's worth noting that these features are common to all
                        programming languages. If you master these fundamentals, you have a head start on coding in

                    <p><a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Variable">Variables</a> are containers that store values. You
                        start by declaring a variable with the <a
                            href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let"><code>let</code></a> keyword,
                        followed by the name you give to the variable:</p>
                    <p>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when
                        you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good
                        practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement. There are other rules for when you
                        should and shouldn't use semicolons. For more details, see <a

                    <p>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means <code>myVariable</code> is not the same as

                    <p>So why do we need variables? Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in
                        programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like

                    <h3>Comments</h3>
                    <p>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text
                        marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <pre class="brush: js notranslate"><code><span class="token comment">/*

                                    */</span>
                                    </code></pre><button type="button" class="icon copy-icon"><span

                    </div>
                    <p>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like
                        this:</p>

                <h3>Conditionals</h3>
                <p>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very
                    common form of conditionals is the <code>if ... else</code> statement. For example:</p>
                <div class="code-example">
                    <pre class="brush: js notranslate"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> iceCream <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'chocolate'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

                                              <span class="token function">alert</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
                                            <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
                                              <span class="token function">alert</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
                                            <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
                                            </code></pre><button type="button" class="icon copy-icon"><span
                            class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span></button><span
                        class="copy-icon-message visually-hidden" role="alert" style="top: 52px;"></span>
                </div>
                <p>The expression inside the <code>if( ... )</code> is the test. This uses the strict equality
                    operator (as described above) to compare the variable <code>iceCream</code> with the string
                    <code>chocolate</code> to see if the two are equal. If this comparison returns
                    <code>true</code>, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second
                    block of code—after the <code>else</code> statement—runs instead.

                <h1>Getting started with React</h1>
                <p>In this article we will say hello to React. We'll discover a little bit of detail about its
                    background and use cases, set up a basic React toolchain on our local computer, and create and play
                    with a simple starter app — learning a bit about how React works in the process.</p>
                <section>
                    <h2>Hello React</h2>
                    <p>As its official tagline states, <a href="https://reactjs.org/" class="external"
                            rel=" noopener">React</a> is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a
                        framework – it's not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to
                        certain environments. For instance, <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" class="external"
                            rel=" noopener">React Native</a> can be used to build mobile applications.</p>
                    <p>To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with <a
                            href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html" class="external"
                            rel=" noopener">ReactDOM</a>. React and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same spaces
                        as — and utilized to solve the same problems as — other true web development frameworks.
                        When we refer to React as a "framework", we're working with that colloquial understanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. It
                        does this through the use of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that
                        describe a portion of the user interface. These components can be composed together to
                        create a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the rendering work, leaving you to
                        concentrate on the UI design.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Use cases</h2>
                    <p>Unlike the other frameworks covered in this module, React does not enforce strict rules
                        around code conventions or file organization. This allows teams to set conventions that work
                        best for them, and to adopt React in any way they would like to. React can handle a single
                        button, a few pieces of an interface, or an app's entire user interface.</p>
                    <p>While React <em>can</em> be used for <a
                            href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html" class="external"
                            rel=" noopener">small pieces of an interface</a>, it's not as easy to "drop into" an
                        application as a library like jQuery, or even a framework like Vue — it is more approachable
                        when you build your entire app with React.</p>
                    <p>In addition, many of the developer-experience benefits of a React app, such as writing
                        interfaces with JSX, require a compilation process. Adding a compiler like Babel to a
                        website makes the code on it run slowly, so developers often set up such tooling with a
                        build step. React arguably has a heavy tooling requirement, but it can be learned.</p>
                    <p>This article is going to focus on the use case of using React to render the entire user
                        interface of an application, using tooling provided by Facebook's own <a

                <h1>Wordpress Introduction</h1>
                <p>WordPress provides the most amazing way of creating websites and
                    blogs. More than 34% of the websites are built using WordPress. So,
                    it can be said that this popular content management system is
                    famous for developing blogging sites and websites. Today, WordPress
                    has proudly brought the most supportive and useful blogging
                    community on the web. Thousands of sites (news, updates, resources,
                    training, tutorials— the list is endless) exists which inherit and
                    make use of WordPress. In this chapter, you will learn about the
                    primary purpose of WordPress and its types and features.</p>
                <h2>What is WordPress?</h2>
                <p>WordPress can be defined as an open-source CMS that has been
                    licensed under GPLv2. It means anyone has the right to use as well
                    as modify the WordPress software for free. It can be considered as
                    a tool that makes the life of content publishers easy to manage an
                    essential portion of the website like website content, and
                    multimedia files in web pages without having prior knowledge of web
                    programming. The ultimate result is that WordPress helps develop
                    and build a website handy for anyone, even without the skill set of
                    a developer.</p>
                <h3>Features of WordPress</h3>
                <p>WordPress is considered to be the most popular content
                    management system due to its characteristics.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>WordPress is free and an open-source platform under the GNU
                        General Public License (GPL).</li>
                    <li>Design themes customization in WordPress is
                        straightforward.</li>
                    <li>It allows you to manage users with different roles and
                        permissions.</li>
                    <li>WordPress media management is quick and easy to use.</li>
                    <li>WordPress provides WYSIWYG editor to manage your text content,
                        which is very useful for manipulating the layout of the
                        document.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>WordPress.com and WordPress.org</h3>
                <p>The two ways through which WordPress allows you to host a site
                    is by WordPress.com and WordPress.org. The primary thing which
                    varies with these two approaches is the real host. By making use of
                    WordPress.org, you might download the script free of charge and
                    host it on a local machine or in any server. Byt, in case of
                    WordPress.com, it takes care of every aspect, right form hosting
                    the site for you to providing features for managing the content.
                    You don't have to organize a web server or pay for hosting or even
                    download any application, but yes, ads will be shown on your
                    site.</p>
                <h3>Pros and Cons of WordPress.org and WordPress.com</h3>
                <p>If you are not paying any interest in hosting or managing a web
                    server, then WordPress.com is a way to go. This is because
                    WordPress.com is free, and setup can be done quickly and easily.
                    However, it will charge you to remove the term WordPress which will
                    be included in the URL as well as you will not be competent enough
                    to upload custom themes and plugins without having a prior payment
                    for the services. You also cannot edit or modify the backend PHP
                    code.</p>
                <p>WordPress.org is a self-hosted version and provides additional
                    flexibility with control on your site. Your self bought domain name
                    can be used, and themes can be uploaded, plugins can be
                    incorporated. Hence, this gives flexibility and custom control to
                    your web development.</p>

            <div class="mamp-page">
                <h1>What Is WAMP</h1>
                <p><strong>WAMP</strong> is an acronym that stands for Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. It’s a software
                    stack which means installing WAMP installs <a href="/tutorials/what-is-apache">Apache</a>, <a
                        href="/tutorials/what-is-mysql">MySQL</a>, and PHP on your operating system (Windows in
                    the case of WAMP). Even though you can install them separately, they are usually bundled up, and for
                    a good reason too.</p>
                <p>What’s good to know is that WAMP derives from <a
                        href="/tutorials/how-to-install-lamp-ubuntu-16-04">LAMP</a> (the L stands for Linux). The only
                    difference
                    between these two is that WAMP is used for Windows, while LAMP – for Linux based operating systems.
                </p>
                <p>Let’s quickly go over what each letter represents:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>“<strong>W</strong>” stands for Windows, there’s also LAMP (for Linux) and MAMP (for Mac).</li>
                    <li>“<strong>A</strong>” stands for Apache. Apache is the server software that is responsible for
                        serving web pages. When you request a page to be seen by you, Apache grants your request over
                        HTTP and shows you the site.</li>
                    <li>“<strong>M</strong>” stands for MySQL. MySQL’s job is to be the database management system for
                        your server. It stores all of the relevant information like your site’s content, user profiles,
                        etc.</li>
                    <li>“<strong>P</strong>” stands for PHP. It’s the programming language that was used to write
                        WordPress. It acts like glue for this whole software stack. PHP is running in conjunction with
                        Apache and communicating with MySQL.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Instead of installing and testing WordPress on your&nbsp;<a href="/web-hosting">hosting account</a>,
                    you can do it on your personal
                    computer (localhost).</p>
                <p>WAMP acts like a virtual server on your computer. It allows you to test all WordPress features
                    without any consequences since it’s localized on your machine and is not connected to the web.</p>
                <p>First of all, this means that you don’t need to wait until files are uploaded to your site, and
                    secondly – this makes creating backups much easier.</p>
                <p>WAMP speeds up the work process for both developers and theme designers alike. What is more, you also
                    get the benefit of playing around with your site to your heart’s content.</p>
                <p>However, to actually make the website go live, you need to get some form of hosting service and a
                    Domain. See our beginner-friendly article about <a href="/tutorials/what-is-web-hosting/">web
                        hosting</a> for
                    more information.</p>
                <p>In essence, WAMP is used as a safe space to work on your website, without needing to actually host it
                    online.</p>
                <p>WAMP also has a control panel. Once you install the software package, all of the services mentioned
                    above (excluding the operating system that is) will be installed on your local machine.</p>
                <p>Whether you use WAMP or software packages for the other operating systems, it’s a great way to save
                    time. You won’t have to upload files to a site and will be able to learn how to develop in a safe
                    and care-free environment.</p>
                <p>You can download WAMP <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">here</a>.</p>

                <h1>An introduction to Git: what it is, and how to use it</h1>
                <section>
                    <p>Git is an <strong>Open Source Distributed Version Control System</strong>. Now that’s a
                        lot of words to define Git.</p>
                    <p>Let me break it down and explain the wording:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Control System:</strong> This basically means that Git is a content tracker.
                            So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store code due to the
                            other features it provides.</li>
                        <li><strong>Version Control System</strong>: The code which is stored in Git keeps
                            changing as more code is added. Also, many developers can add code in parallel. So
                            Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what
                            changes have happened. Also, Git provides features like branches and merges, which I
                            will be covering later.</li>
                        <li><strong>Distributed Version Control System</strong>: Git has a remote repository
                            which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer
                            of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server,
                            but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. Git is a
                            Distributed Version Control System since the code is present in every developer’s
                            computer. I will explain the concept of remote and local repositories later in this
                            article.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Why a Version Control System like Git is needed</h3>
                    <p>Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version
                        control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the
                        developers.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system
                        allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.</p>
                    <p>Finally, sometimes several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same
                        codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important.</p>
                    <h3>Let’s get started on using Git now</h3>
                    <p>Rather than mentioning all the concepts at once, I will explain the concepts of Git
                        through an example so that it is easier to follow.</p>
                    <h4>Download git</h4>
                    <p>This link has details on how to install Git in multiple operating systems:<br><a
                            href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Verify if Git is installed by using the following command in the command prompt:</p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git --version</code></pre>
                    <h4 id="create-your-local-git-repository">Create your local Git repository</h4>
                    <p>In your computer, create a folder for your project. Let’s call the project folder
                        <code>simple-git-demo</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Go into your project folder and add a local Git repository to the project using the
                        following commands:</p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">cd simple-git-demo git init</code></pre>
                    <p>The <code>git init</code> command adds a local Git repository to the project.</p>
                    <h4 id="let-s-add-some-small-code-now">Let’s Add some Small Code now</h4>
                    <p>Create a file called <code>demo.txt</code> in the project folder and add the following
                        text into it:</p>
                    <pre><code>Initial Content</code></pre>
                    <p>Here we will be demoing with just plain text instead of actual code, since the main focus
                        of this article is on Git and not on any specific programming language.</p>
                    <h3 id="staging-and-committing-the-code">Staging and Committing the code</h3>
                    <p>Committing is the process in which the code is added to the <strong>local
                            repository</strong>. Before committing the code, it has to be in the <strong>staging
                            area</strong>. The staging area is there to keep track of all the files which are to
                        be committed.</p>
                    <p>Any file which is not added to the staging area will not be committed. This gives the
                        developer control over which files need to be committed.</p>
                    <h4 id="staging">Staging</h4>
                    <p>Use the following command for staging the file:</p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git add demo.txt</code></pre>
                    <p>In case you want to add multiple files you can use:</p>
                    <p><code>git add file1 file2 file3</code></p>
                    <p>If you want to add all the files inside your project folder to the staging area, use the
                        following command:</p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git add .</code></pre>
                    <p>Use this carefully since it adds all the files and folders in your project to the staging
                        area.</p>
                    <h4 id="committing">Committing</h4>
                    <p>Use the following command to commit the file:</p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git commit -m "Initial Commit"</code></pre>
                    <p>“Initial Commit” is the commit message here. Enter a relevant commit message to indicate
                        what code changes were done in that particular commit.</p>
                    <h3 id="git-status-and-git-log">Git Status and Git Log</h3>
                    <p>Now modify the <code>demo.txt</code><strong> </strong>file and add the following snippet:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>Initial Content Adding more Content</code></pre>
                    <h4 id="status">Status</h4>
                    <p>Use <code>git status</code> to find out information regarding what files are modified and
                        what files are there in the staging area — it shows other information as well, which we
                        can ignore for now.</p>
                    <p>Use the following command to see the status:</p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git status</code></pre>
                    <p>The status shows that <code>demo.txt</code> is modified and is not yet in the staging
                        area.</p>
                    <p>Now let us add <code>demo.txt</code> to the staging area and commit it using the
                        following commands:</p>
                    <pre
                        class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git add demo.txt git commit -m "demo.txt file is modified"</code></pre>
                    <h3 id="log">Log</h3>
                    <p>Use <code>git log</code> to print out all the commits which have been done up until now.
                    </p>
                    <p>The command used for this is:<br><code>git log</code></p>
                    <p>The log shows the author of each commit, the date of the commit, and the commit message.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="branches">Branches</h3>
                    <p>Up until now we have not created any branch in Git. By default, Git commits go into the
                        <strong>master</strong> branch.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="what-is-a-branch">What is a branch?</h4>
                    <p>A branch is nothing but a pointer to the latest commit in the Git repository. So
                        currently our master branch is a pointer to the second commit
                        <code>“demo.txt file is modified”</code>.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="why-are-multiple-branches-needed">Why are multiple branches needed?</h4>
                    <p>Multiple branches are needed to support multiple parallel developments. Refer the image
                        below to see how branches work.</p>
                    <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img
                            src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/sww3mboJ61C4kpLWlQYHnHWvrjX8p--VMui2">
                    </figure>
                    <p>Initially, commit 1 and commit 2 were done in the master branch. After commit 2 a new
                        Branch called as “Test” is created, and commit 3 and commit 4 are added to the test
                        branch.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, a different commit 3 and commit 4 are added to the master branch. Here
                        we can see that after Commit 2, two parallel developments are being done in 2 separate
                        branches.</p>
                    <p>The Test Branch and the Master Branch have diverged here and have different code — the
                        code from Test Branch can be merged with the Master branch using <code>git merge</code>.
                        This will be covered later.</p>
                    <h4 id="create-a-new-branch-in-local">Create a New Branch in Local</h4>
                    <p>Create a new branch called <strong>test</strong> using the following command:</p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git branch test</code></pre>
                    <p>This command creates the <code>test</code> branch.</p>
                    <p>We are still in the context of the master branch. In order to switch to the
                        <code>test </code>branch. use the following command:
                    </p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git checkout test</code></pre>
                    <p>Now we are in the <code>test</code> branch.</p>
                    <p>You can list out all the branches in local using the following command:</p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git branch</code></pre>
                    <h4 id="do-some-commits-in-the-new-branch">Do Some Commits in the New Branch</h4>
                    <p>Modify <code>demo.txt</code> by adding the following snippet:</p>
                    <pre><code>Initial Content Adding more Content Adding some Content from test Branch</code></pre>
                    <p>Now stage and commit using the following commands:</p>
                    <pre
                        class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git add demo.txt git commit -m "Test Branch Commit"</code></pre>
                    <p>This commit was done in the Test Branch, and now Test Branch is ahead of Master Branch by
                        1 commit — as the test branch also includes the 2 commits from the master branch.</p>
                    <p>You can verify the commit history in Test Branch using:</p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git log</code></pre>
                    <h3 id="merging">Merging</h3>
                    <p>Currently, Test Branch is ahead of the Master by 1 commit. Let’s say that now we want all
                        the code in the Test Branch to be brought back to the Master Branch. This is where
                        <code>git merge</code> is very useful.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to merge the code from the test branch into the master branch, follow these
                        steps:</p>
                    <p>First go back to the master branch:</p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git checkout master</code></pre>
                    <p>Then run the <code>merge</code> command:</p>
                    <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">git merge test</code></pre>
                    <p>After running these 2 commands, the merge should be successful. In this example, there
                        are no conflicts.</p>
                    <p>But in real projects, there will be conflicts when a merge is being done. Resolving the
                        conflict is something which comes with experience, so as you work more with Git you will
                        be able to get the hang of resolving conflicts.</p>
                    <p>Run <code>git log</code><strong> </strong>now and you will notice that the master also
                        has 3 commits.</p>
                    <h3 id="the-remote-git-repository">The Remote Git Repository</h3>
                    <p>Until now, we have been working only in the local repository. Each developer will work in
                        their local repository but eventually, they will push the code into a remote repository.
                        Once the code is in the remote repository, other developers can see and modify that
                        code.</p>

                    <p>Here we will be using GitHub for the remote repository.</p>
                    <p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener">https://github.com/</a> and create an
                        account.</p>
                    <p>After registering in the GitHub homepage, click on <strong>Start a Project</strong> to
                        create a new Git repository. Give the repository a name and click “Create Repository”
                    </p>
                    <p>Give the name as <code>git-blog-demo</code>.</p>
                    <p>This will create a remote repository in GitHub, and when you open the repository, a page
                        like the image below will open up:</p>

                    programmer write code, helps in debugging and corrects the code using the intelli-sense method ”. In
                    normal
                    terms, it facilitates users to write the code in an easy manner. Many people say that it is half of
                    an IDE
                    and an editor, but the decision is up to to the coders. Any program/software that we see or use
                    works on the
                    code that runs in the background. Traditionally coding was used to do in the traditional editors or
                    even in
                    the basic editors like notepad! These editors used to provide basic support to the coders.</p>
                <p>Some of them were so basic that it was very difficult in writing basic English level programs in
                    them. As
                    time went by, some programming languages needed a specific framework and support for further coding
                    and
                    development it, which was not possible using these editors. VI Editor, Sublime Text Editor, is one
                    of the
                    many kinds of editors that came into existence. The most prominent and which supports almost every
                    coding
                    language is VISUAL STUDIO CODE. Its features let the user modify the editor as per the usage, which
                    means
                    the user is able to download the libraries from the internet and integrate it with the code as per
                    his
                    requirements.</p>
                <h3>What can Visual Studio Code do?</h3>
                <p>Visual Studio Code has some very unique features. They are listed as below :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Support for multiple programming languages: </strong>Supports multiple programming
                        languages. So
                        earlier, programmers needed Web-Support: a different editor for different languages, but it has
                        built-in
                        multi-language support. This also means it easily detects if there’s any fault or cross-language
                        reference, it’ll be able to detect it easily.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intelli-Sense: </strong>It can detect if any snippet of code is left incomplete. Also,
                        common
                        variable syntaxes and variable declarations are made automatically. Ex: If a certain variable is
                        being
                        used in the program and the user has forgotten to declare, intelli-sense will declare it for the
                        user.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Platform Support: </strong>Traditionally, editors used to support either <a
                            href="https://www.educba.com/linux-vs-mac-vs-windows/">Windows or Linux or Mac Systems</a>.
                        But
                        Visual Studio Code is cross-platform. So it can work on all three platforms. Also, the code
                        works on all
                        three platforms; else, the open-source and proprietary software codes used to be different.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Extensions and Support: </strong>Usually supports all the programming languages but, if
                        the
                        user/programmer wants to use the programming language which is not supported then, he can
                        download the
                        extension and use it. And performance-wise, the extension doesn’t slow down the editor as it
                        rums as a
                        different process.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Repository: </strong>With the ever-increasing demand for the code, secure and timely
                        storage is
                        equally important. It is <a href="https://www.educba.com/git-alternatives/">connected with
                            Git</a> or
                        can be connected with any other repository for pulling or saving the instances.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web-Support: </strong>Comes with built-in support for Web applications. So web
                        applications can
                        be built and supported in VSC.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Advantages and Why should we use Visual Studio Code</h3>
                <p>There are many advantages over any other IDE; they are as follow:</p>
                <p>1. Cross-platform support :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Windows</li>
                    <li>Linux</li>
                    <li>Mac</li>
                </ul>
                <p>2. Light-weight</p>
                <p>3. Robust Architecture</p>
                <p>4. Intelli-Sense</p>
                <p>5. Freeware: Free of Cost- probably the best feature of all for all the programmers out there, even
                    more for
                    the organizations.</p>
                <p>6. Many users will use it or might have used it for desktop applications only, but it also provides
                    great
                    tool support for Web Technologies like; HTML, CSS, JSON.</p>
                <p>There are a few things that one can find a bit odd compared with so many features. It mainly helps
                    the
                    front-end developers as compared with the back-end developers. But as per some user’s opinions, it
                    is
                    equally helpful. It supports most of the languages used by most of the programmers, but other
                    languages
                    might have to download, or extensions may have to be used for them. Along with this common zoom-in,
                    zoom-out
                    brightness, theme selection features too are made available.</p>
                <h3>Visual Studio Scope</h3>
                <p>The most common languages are :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>Visual Basic</li>
                    <li>Java-Script</li>
                    <li>R</li>
                    <li>XML</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>GO</li>
                    <li>PERL</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Another feature that naïve-users or anyone can see instantly different from other editors is the
                    user-friendliness of the Visual Studio Code. The usability is very easy to handle. The file is
                    arranged
                    hierarchically and has regular software like a toolbar, status bar, and a sidebar. It also has a
                    floating
                    windows explorer window, which can be fixed at one place according to convenience, which consists of
                    the
                    directory structure of files. These files (code files, image folders, etc.) can be opened or renamed
                    from
                    here, and changes will automatically get reflected in the storage.</p>
                <h3>Why do we need Visual Studio Code?</h3>
                <p>Till recent times, there’s hardly been an IDE or code editor that has been so user-friendly that even
                    first-time users can use each and every feature without any hassles. The coding-friendly feature and
                    code
                    error recognition also helps users a long way into making the code more efficient and error-less.
                </p>
                <h3>How will this technology help you in career growth?</h3>
                <p>With new and emerging technologies, and new frameworks being used by the software, this brings into
                    play a
                    great variety of code effectiveness. These emerging technologies are a sure thing that is to be
                    added into
                    the Visual Studio Code and its extensions. The developers, testers, data administrators, both old
                    and
                    newbies, can equally use it, and that too very effectively. The people who are into this industry
                    might find
                    it a bit tough to learn this new technology, considering their use of more manual modes of code
                    logic.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>With advancements in technology day-by-day, Visual Studio Code is going to play a pivotal role in the
                    development of software. With its ever-evolving features and soon-to-be-added new settings, which
                    will
                    enable users to work with it from anywhere, it is certainly “THE THING” to keep one ahead of
                    everyone in
                    this ever-increasing IT market.</p>

                <h1>jQuery | Introduction</h1>
                <p><strong>jQuery </strong>is an open source JavaScript library that simplifies the interactions
                    between an HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the Document Object Model (DOM), and
                    JavaScript.<br>Elaborating the terms, jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing and
                    manipulation, browser event handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser
                    JavaScript development.<br><img
                        src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/jquery-banner.png"
                        alt=""><br><b>Note:</b> The only library available today that meets the needs of both
                    designer types and programmer types is jQuery.</p>
                <p>jQuery is widely famous with its philosophy of <strong>“Write less, do more.”</strong> This
                    philosophy can be further elaborated as three concepts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finding some elements (via CSS selectors) and doing something with them (via jQuery methods)
                        i.e. locate a set of elements in the DOM, and then do something with that set of elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Chaining multiple jQuery methods on a set of elements</li>
                    <li>Using the jQuery wrapper and implicit iteration</li>
                </ul>
                <p><u><strong>Using jQuery (JS) library on HTML page</strong></u><br>There are several ways to start
                    using jQuery on your web site.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use the Google-hosted/ Microsoft-hosted content delivery network (CDN) to include a version
                        of jQuery.</li>
                    <li>Download own version of jQuery from jQuery.com and host it on own server or local
                        filesystem.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Note:</b> All jQuery methods are inside a document-ready event to prevent any jQuery code from
                    running before the document is finished loading (is ready).</p>
                <p><b>Why jQuery?</b><br>Some of the key points which support the answer for why to use jQuery:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is incredibly popular, which is to say it has a large community of users and a healthy
                        amount of contributors who participate as developers and evangelists.</li>
                    <li>It normalizes the differences between web browsers so that you don’t have to.</li>
                    <li>It is intentionally a lightweight footprint with a simple yet clever plugin architecture.
                    </li>
                    <li>Its repository of plugins is vast and has seen steady growth since jQuery’s release.</li>
                    <li>Its API is fully documented, including inline code examples, which in the world of
                        JavaScript libraries is a luxury. Heck, any documentation at all was a luxury for years.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is friendly, which is to say it provides helpful ways to avoid conflicts with other
                        JavaScript libraries.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wide range of plug-ins. jQuery allows developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript
                        library.</li>
                    <li>Large development community</li>
                    <li>It has a good and comprehensive documentation</li>
                    <li>It is a lot more easy to use compared to standard javascript and other javascript libraries.
                    </li>
                    <li>JQuery lets users develop Ajax templates with ease, Ajax enables a sleeker interface where
                        actions can be performed on pages without requiring the entire page to be reloaded.</li>
                    <li>Being Light weight and a powerful chaining capabilities makes jQuery more strong.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While JQuery has an impressive library in terms of quantity, depending on how much
                        customization you require on your website, the functionality may be limited thus using raw
                        javascript may be inevitable in some cases.</li>
                    <li>The JQuery javascript file is required to run JQuery commands, while the size of this file
                        is relatively small (25-100KB depending on the server), it is still a strain on the client
                        computer and maybe your web server as well if you intend to host the JQuery script on your
                        own web server.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating
                    responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                    framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It solves many problems which we had
                    once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect
                    for all the browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets,
                    Phablets, and Phones). All thanks to Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of
                    Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Text editors, also called code editors, are applications used
                by developers to write code. They highlight and format your code so that it’s easier
                to read and understand. If you’ve used Codecademy, you’re already familiar with a
                text editor! It’s the area you write your code in.</p>
            <p>Text editors provide a number of advantages to web
                developers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Language-specific syntax highlighting</li>
                <li>Automatic code indentation</li>
                <li>Color schemes to suit your preferences and optimize
                    code readability</li>
                <li>Plug-ins to catch errors in the code</li>
                <li>A tree view of your project’s folders and files, so you
                    can conveniently navigate your project</li>
                <li>Key shortcuts for faster development</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1. CHOOSING A TEXT EDITOR</h4>
            <p>There are a number of text editors to choose from. Atom and
                Sublime Text are two of the most popular text editors used by developers.</p>
            <p>Sublime Text has been the text editor of choice for many
                years. It is stable and reliable.</p>
            <p>Atom was released by GitHub after Sublime Text. It’s a fully
                customizable text editor. Since Atom is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you
                can customize it yourself once you’ve learned those languages.</p>
            <p>Either text editor is great for development, so you can’t
                make a bad decision here. When you are further along in your coding career, try
                another code editor to see what features work well with your workflow.</p>
            <p><strong>Exercise I: Download Atom</strong></p>
            <p>This video details how to download and install Atom.</p>
            <p>In this exercise, we recommend you follow these steps to
                download Atom.</p>
            <p><strong>OS X</strong></p>
            <p>Atom works on Macs running OS X 10.8 or later.
                Visit the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom homepage </a> and click Download For Mac. In a few
                moments, Atom will appear in your Downloads folder as a .zip file:</p>
            <p>Click on atom-mac.zip to extract the application, then drag
                the new icon into your Applications folder.
                Double-click the application icon to load Atom and get started.</p>
            <p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
            <p>Atom supports Windows 7 or later.
                Visit <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.12.9"> this </a> webpage and
                download <strong>atom-windows.zip</strong>. In a few moments, Atom will appear in
                your Downloads folder as a .zip file.</p>
            <p>Follow the instructions in the Windows Installer to get
                started. You can visit Atom’s Windows install page for more detailed instructions.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Development Folders</h4>
            <p>Before using your text editor, it’s important to establish an
                organized file system. As the number and size of your projects grow, it becomes
                increasingly important to know where to save new projects and find old projects.
            </p>
            <p>Most developers store their projects in an easy-to-find
                directory (what you might be used to calling a folder). Here at Codecademy, we
                recommend naming this directory <code class="styles_code__NWUNd">projects</code>. It
                will store all of your coding projects. Whenever you create a new project, no matter
                how small, you should always make a new folder inside your <code
                    class="styles_code__NWUNd">projects</code> directory. You will find that
                single-file projects can quickly turn into large, multi-folder projects. </p>
            <p><strong>Exercise II: Create a dev folder</strong></p>
            <p>Below are the steps you need to follow to create a new folder
                for all of your programming projects. You will also learn how to load a new project
                folder into Atom. For steps 1 and 2, navigate to a folder using Finder (Mac users)
                or My Computer (PC users).</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Navigate to a folder you visit regularly and create a
                        new folder called <code class="styles_code__NWUNd">projects</code>. On Mac,
                        this may be your User account. On PC, you may want to save this on your C
                        drive.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Inside the <code class="styles_code__NWUNd">projects</code> directory, create a new
                        folder called <code class="styles_code__NWUNd">HelloWorld</code>. Everything
                        you add to this folder will be part of your <code class="styles_code__NWUNd">HelloWorld</code>
                        project.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Open Atom on your computer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Atom provides a tree view of your project, so you can
                        conveniently navigate to different folders and files. In the Atom menu bar,
                        choose File &gt; Add Project Folder. This will launch your file manager.
                        Navigate to the <code class="styles_code__NWUNd">HelloWorld</code> folder
                        and select Open. The folder will open in Atom’s side pane. At this point,
                        there should not be any contents in the folder. We’ll add a file in the next
                        exercise.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>3. Adding a File</h4>
            <p>When you open Atom, the Welcome Guide will appear. For now,
                we’ll skip getting to know Atom and start writing some code.</p>
            <p>Before you learn how to add files to a project folder, it is
                important to understand the purpose of file extensions.</p>
            <p>A <em>file extension</em> is the suffix of a filename and
                describes the type of content the file contains. The file extension is always the
                last 3 or 4 characters in a filename, preceded by a period. For example, the HTML
                file extension is <code class="styles_code__NWUNd">.html</code>, and it tells the
                browser (and other applications) to interpret the contents of the file as a web
                page. </p>
            <p>Once Atom loads a project folder, you can add files. The
                steps below describe how to add files. Don’t worry about doing this on your own
                computer. We’ll get to that in Exercise III.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In Atom’s top bar, select File &gt; New File. An
                    untitled, blank file will appear.</li>
                <li>In Atom’s top bar, choose File &gt; Save or Save As.
                    Name the file with its appropriate file extension (<code class="styles_code__NWUNd">.html</code>,
                    <code class="styles_code__NWUNd">.css</code>, <code class="styles_code__NWUNd">.csv</code>). It is
                    critical that you include the
                    correct file extension, so programs know how to interpret its contents.
                </li>
                <li>Begin coding! Save your file often. This will decrease
                    the chances of losing unsaved work. </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>4. File Extensions and Syntax
                Highlighting</h4>
            <p>Atom and other text editors are able to interpret file
                extensions and provide language-specific syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting is
                a tool for making code <em>easier</em> to read. Take a look at your
                <strong>index.html</strong> file. The text and tags are different colors. This is
                how Atom highlights <strong>.html</strong> syntax. With each new language you learn,
                Atom will highlight text in a way that makes your code easy to read. This may be
                different than other text editors and also different than the way your code is
                highlighted on Codecademy.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Exercise IV: Open your HTML File in a web
                    browser</strong></p>
            <p>At this point, your file is ready to be viewed in a web
                browser. The following steps should be taken <strong>outside of Atom</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Back in your file system, navigate to the
                        <strong>index.html</strong> file in your Hello World folder.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Double click <strong>index.html</strong>. the page
                        should open in your default web browser.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Congratulations! You can create web pages on your own
                computer!</p>
