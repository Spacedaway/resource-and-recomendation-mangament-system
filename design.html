                    design, graphic design…for the laypeople among us, all of these terms are enough to make
                    your head swirl (hint hint: it might be because they’re all related).</p>
                <p>Recently, we spilled the tea on UX and UI design (and even covered the differences and similarities
                    they share with graphic design). Now,
                    we’re explaining the field of digital design and sharing all the reasons it plays an
                    important role in the digital world.</p>
                <p>Today, we’re digging deeper into the following
                    questions:</p>
                <ul>

                        digital design and other types of design work?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Buckle up and get ready to learn about digital design and all the
                    ways it helps make our digital lives easy, breezy, and beautiful.</p>
                <h2>What is digital design?</h2>
                <p>First things first: digital design spans several forms, but it’s
                    essentially design work made for digital spaces. To keep it simple, digital design is
                    content created for and viewed on a digital screen. You might be thinking, “Hey, this sounds
                    really broad.” And you’d be correct. Digital design is a
                    broad field and is often used as an umbrella term to describe several types of design work
                    including UX/UI design, graphic design, and web design (more on this below).
                </p>
                <p>Within the world of design, there are those who work in the
                    physical world creating print designs and those who work in the digital world creating
                    digital designs. Here’s an even further breakdown:</p>
                <p>Print projects include magazines, brochures, business cards,
                    print ads, book covers, and other design work you’d find in the physical world. Conversely,
                    digital designs include deliverables you’d find on the web and other digital
                    platforms.</p>
                <h2>What do digital designers create?</h2>
                <p>Digital designers create design deliverables that live on digital
                    platforms like websites or applications. Some of these deliverables include things
                    like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PDF graphics for content like
                        white papers or reports</span></li>
                    <li>Website graphics and
                        layouts</li>
                    <li>Interactive elements like
                        buttons</span></li>
                    <li>Infographics</span></li>
                    <li>Wireframes and
                        prototypes</li>
                    <li>Digital ads</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tracking the success of digital design through
                    analytics</h3>
                <p>Digital design tracks its success through analytics. This sets it
                    apart from print design and gives it a leg up as designers can track how many eyes are on
                    their designs through things like engagement (likes, comments) and page views. A digital
                    designer may create several variations of a design and monitor its success through the use
                    of analytics. They may conduct A/B testing with the different design variations to see which
                    variation users best respond to. This can be especially helpful for companies using their
                    digital designs to help advertise or sell a product or service.</p>
                <h3>Interactivity and digital design</h3>
                <p>A major way digital design differs from print design is that it
                    can be, and often is, interactive. Interactivity means the digital design can respond to you
                    (the user) and serves a functional purpose. For example, a checkout button on an online
                    store can be clicked on to initiate&nbsp; a purchase process. This feature would be
                    considered interactive. It’s important to note here that not all forms of digital design are
                    interactive, some graphics like logos or infographics can simply serve the purpose of
                    branding or telling a story.</p>
                <h2>Which careers fall under digital design?</h2>
                <p>You might be thinking, “Ok. I think I get it. But, what’s the
                    difference between digital design and other types of design work?” Like we said, digital
                    design encompasses several forms of design work. This news is especially exciting for people
                    who are interested in working in the field because different strengths can be used across
                    the medium. Thus, the job prospects are plentiful. Here are a few career options for those
                    interested in digital design.</p>
                <h3>Graphic Designers</h3>
                <p>Graphic Designers work to create cohesive branding through the
                    use of visual elements. They often create fixed images rather than interactive ones. One
                    thing to remember is Graphic Designers also work in the print world. They produce
                    deliverables like banner ads, logos, business cards, infographics, and digital
                    illustrations.</p>
                <h3>UX/UI Designers</h3>
                <p>UX and UI Designers work together to create intuitive, beautiful,
                    and functional mobile apps, websites, and products. User Interface Designers work
                    specifically to make digital interfaces enjoyable and easy-to-use through the use of
                    aesthetics. User Experience Designers, however, ensure users have the best experience
                    throughout their entire journey using a product, app, or website. Like Graphic Designers, UX
                    Designers can also work in physical spaces but you’ll mostly hear about them working in the
                    digital world these days. UI design is a strictly digital practice. Oftentimes, these roles
                    are merged into one.</p>
                <h3>Web Designers</h3>
                <p>Web Designers offer design services specifically catered to the
                    web. They create layouts and web pages, merging the work of a graphic designer with
                    coding. The end
                    result is an accessible, aesthetically pleasing, and easy-to-use website.</p>
                <h2>Why is digital design important?</h2>
                <p>Our lives are largely online in 2020, so the design of our online
                    interactions<br>
                    is hugely important. Digital design affects the way we
                    work, learn, shop, and socialize. Think of it this way: elements of digital design affect
                    our purchasing decisions. When we shop online, we rely on the website to direct us (through
                    design) to the pair of shoes we’re looking for. The usability of the site, the navigation,
                    and the checkout button were all thoughtfully created by a digital designer (probably a UX
                    and UI Designer in this case).</p>
                <p>Digital design ensures we have useful experiences in the online
                    world. It can be especially important for business owners who need aesthetically pleasing
                    designs to attract and retain customers. For students who are largely going to school online
                    right now, it’s important that their digital educational tools are easy to understand and
                    navigate so they can be successful in their studies. The same goes for workers who use
                    digital tools in their day-to-day lives: from communications to file sharing, an effective
                    interface can make our jobs easier.</p>

    <div class="home-section default-section Unsplash" style="display: none;">
        <div class="Unsplash-page">
            <h1>Unsplash: The Perfect Source for Free Images?</h1>
            <h2><b>What is Unsplash?</b></h2>
            <p>Unsplash is a free
                stock photography site. The website has more than one hundred thousand contributing photographers.
                Even more impressive is the number of photo impressions ( more than 10 billion per month) on their
                photo library which has surpassed 1.5 million photos.</p>
            <h2><b>How Does Unsplash Work?</b></h2>
            <p>Unsplash is based on the premise that photographers upload their work to the site.
                These photos are in turn curated by editors. Users are free to download the photos and use them in
                any way they want with no restrictions.</p>
            <h2><b>License</b></h2>
            <p>The Unsplash license is very permissive. It is like a Creative Commons Zero License
                (CC0). It allows users to use photos for commercial or non-commercial purposes without providing any
                attribution or obtaining permission. This has allowed the service to become one of the largest
                photography suppliers on the web. Whether you are a blog writer looking for images to perfectly suit
                your content, or a company looking to visually tell a story about itself.</p>
            <p>In fact, Unsplash has become so popular you may be realizing that you have seen
                images downloaded from it in many online articles and websites.</p>
            <p>The license was updated in 2018 and now does not allow Unsplash photos to be sold
                without being first modified, which includes printed images and photos printed on goods.</p>
            <h2><b>App</b></h2>
            <p>The Unsplash App is an app on the Apple App Store. You can use it on your iPhone or
                iPad. It includes useful features such as drag and drop of photos, and submission of photos to
                Unsplash right from your portable device. No subscription is required and you have access to over
                1.5 millions free images. Not bad for an app.
            <p>There is also an android app named Unsplash. However from user reviews it seems that
                it is more limited than the iOS version and has some issues to be worked out.</p>
            <h2><b>Unsplash Photos</b></h2>
            <p>Thanks to the entrepreneurial vision of the creators of the site, Unsplash photos
                have made their way to the far reaches of the internet and beyond. They have helped create websites,
                demos, physical products, brochures, and many other products. Businesses, independent creators,
                educational institutions and non-profits have all benefited from the site.</p>
            <h2><b>Free Pictures To Use for Business</b></h2>
            <p>Unsplash had an interesting beginning. Its creator was having trouble locating images
                for his company website and ended up having to hire a photographer. Later, he posted the photos
                publicly on a social media platform and encouraged others to use them.</p>
            <p>The practice of companies using photos for profit without paying the photographers is
                somewhat controversial now.
            <h2><b>How Does Unsplash Make Money?</b></h2>
            <p>Unsplash is going to be making money through its Unsplash For Brands service,
                described later.</p>
            <h2><b>Unsplash Photos for Free</b></h2>
            <p>Sharing something for free, although it may seem counterintuitive at first, attracts
                contributors. As a result of that the audience grows even larger and the cycle repeats. It has been
                found that a majority of users who get their images from Unplash have never downloaded stock images.
                This larger audience is what many companies are after but cannot reach.</p>
            <p>Don’t forget: Nothing beats free. And this does not only apply to photos. Once you
                have a free service that draws millions of hits a month, think about all the ways you can utilize
                that traffic.</p>
            <p>One more interesting thing is, if you click on the info button for a photo, you
                basically get to see the camera settings for the image, including camera make, aperture, shutter
                speed, dimensions, focal length and ISO. How great is that, you can see what settings were used to
                take your favorite images. There is also a share button so you can quickly share a photo via email
                or social media.</p>
            <p>What do you think? How has your experience been with Unsplash? Any issues our readers
                should know about? Any other similar services I missed?</p>

    <div class="home-section default-section Offset" style="display: none;">
        <div class="Offset-page">
            <h1>Introducing Offset: What It Means for the Contributor Community</h1>
            <p><strong>What is Offset?</strong> Created by Shutterstock, Offset is a new site showcasing an entirely
                new collection of images. The site is currently open to select preview customers at</p>
            <p>Offset’s purpose is to offer high-quality commercial and editorial imagery with simple and clear
                licensing terms through an elegant customer experience. Offset images will be available with
                royalty-free licenses at flat, per-image pricing.</p>
            <p>Offset images are gathered from world-class assignment photographers, publishers, and agencies, with
                a focus on unique, authentic content. This collection of images is not available on Shutterstock or
                vice versa, and Offset images are not available by subscription. Offset images are independently
                sourced and do not come from Shutterstock contributors.</p>
            <p><strong>Why create a new site?</strong></p>
            <p>Offset is more than a unique collection; it’s a unique search experience, purchasing experience and
                brand that’s specifically tailored to the needs of buyers of high-end imagery.</p>
            <p><strong>How is Offset content different from Shutterstock content?</strong></p>
            <p>In contrast to Shutterstock’s submission and review process, each Offset image is hand-selected by a
                team of curators. The Offset team seeks out exceptional photos and illustrations with specific
                qualities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Beautiful images that tell a story alone or together</li>
                <li>Authentic and natural-looking images</li>
                <li>Sophisticated and contemporary art direction and style</li>
                <li>The highest production values and standards</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Who are the artists who contribute to Offset? Can I contribute?</strong></p>
            <p>Offset contributors are visual storytellers with a deep passion for their craft. Many are dedicated
                assignment photographers and illustrators who have never licensed their images as stock before.
                Currently the process is highly selective and by invitation only.</p>
            <p><strong>Who decides which images are chosen for Offset?</strong></p>
            <p>Offset curators have comprehensive backgrounds in photography and illustration, with prior experience
                working with the top photographers and studios at leading image agencies, publishers, and consumer
                brands. Those brands include National Geographic, William Sonoma, Trunk Archive, the Associated
                Press, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, and others.</p>
            <p><strong>How is Offset being rolled out?</strong></p>
            <p>Our goal is for Offset to join the Shutterstock family as the premier destination for visually
                powerful, authentic, and hard-to-find images. For now, Offset is open only to a preview audience of
                customers. However, we plan to expand the number of invited customers, open the site to the public,
                and ramp up our marketing throughout 2013.</p>

                ipsum of graphic embellishment in todays product landscape.</p>
            <p>Humaaans is a library of
                vector based, free-to-use illustrations launched in late 2018 by Pablo Stanley, Design Lead at
                InVision. Upon its arrival, this mix-and-match collection exploded in popularity, inspiring waves of
                similarly floaty, ambiguous humanoids that remain on-trend to this day.</p>
            <p>For many upstart product designers, illustration libraries are a
                practical resource to easily extend the communication around a product. As with all free asset
                collections, they can expedite the design process while elevating the status of the original
                creator.</p>
            <p>However, for companies trying to establish a brand, these libraries can
                act as pitfalls against finding a unique voice within the market.</p>
            <h1>The Purpose of Illustrations</h1>
            <p>Their role in product.</p>
            <p>Illustrations used in product need to live within the context of a
                brand. This means that effective graphics are supplemental to the overall messaging, serving only to
                elevate what is already being communicated through an established design system. If a team finds
                benefit in curating illustrations, time, attention, and budget is needed in order to make sure the
                deliverables add value to the product experience.</p>
            <p>Several digital product companies already utilize custom illustrations
                to elevate their brand experience. Examples include:</p>
            <p><strong>Duolingo</strong> uses its famous owl and
                school-like graphics to communicate their friendly, game-based approach to language learning. Most
                graphics in the app serve as visual aids within lessons.</p>
            <p><strong>CoStar</strong> incorporates abstract symbols and
                objects to add a little mysticism to an otherwise pulled-back, monochromatic astrology brand.</p>
            <p><strong>Byte</strong> uses colourful 3D renderings to
                communicate the diversity of content found within the app, suggesting an energetic and ever-changing
                experience.</p>
            <p>Despite their differences, the common thread between these apps is how
                they use graphics as a tool to push communication. Everything is presented with a purpose in mind,
                elevating the brands overall messaging.</p>
            <p>All too often, designers plonk in graphics because someone decided “we
                need something here”. This is when libraries like Humaaans
                come into play. Without consideration into the communication intent behind their illustrations,
                designers reach for the most immediate aesthetic option on hand. This graphics-for-the-sake-of-it
                approach dilutes the core messaging of a product through visual ambiguity.</p>
            <p>To avoid this, designers looking to add a little art should ask
                themselves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What would graphics serve to effectively communicate
                    within the product?</li>
                <li>How would their presentation elevate the voice of
                    our brand?</li>
            </ul>

    <div class="home-section default-section Vexels" style="display: none;">
        <div class="Vexels-page">
            <h2>What is Vexels?</h2>
            <p>Vexels is your one-stop solution for
                finding Merch-ready designs and graphics. With Vexels, you no longer need to search
                Google manually for each and every graphic you want to use. You can download everything from
                backgrounds to icons, text phrases, “Merch-ready designs”, and even t-shirt mockups!</p>
            <p>All of their designs look amazing. With over 43,000 graphics in their database, you
                can find just about anything for any type of design. Content is updated daily, so you will always
                have new designs to look through. Most of them are editable so you can quickly and easily customize
                them to your liking.</p>
            <h2>What can Vexels designs be used for?</h2>
            <p>For Merchers, VEXELS can be used to source great Merch-ready Designs you can sell t-shirts with on
                Merch by Amazon and other PODs.</p>
            <p>If subscribed, they can be used for creating Merch by Amazon t-shirt designs. But, there is <em>so
                    much more</em> that it can be used for. Here’s a few more example:</p>
            <h3>Adding Vectors To Existing Designs</h3>
            <p>I’ve mentioned this several times before, but creating t-shirt variations of best-selling shirts is a
                great way to increase your monthly earnings. When you think about it, it makes perfect sense. Rather
                than upload designs in niches you haven’t explored, you can create variations of already selling
                designs. This is great for both you and the customer because it gives them more variety to choose
                from, and is great for you because it gives you a better chance at someone purchasing either of your
                designs.</p>
            <p>Let’s say you have a t-shirt of a bear that is selling pretty well on Amazon. With Vexels, you could
                quickly download a vector of a tree, slap it on your design, and upload that.</p>
            <p>You now have a similar, but still different, variation of your best-selling design.</p>
            <h3>For Designers</h3>
            <p>If you are a designer, then Vexels would be perfect for you. Vexels offers a “Merch Subscription
                Plan” specifically for Merch Sellers and Merch Designers. If you prefer to outsource your designs,
                you can still make use of Vexels. Simply find the artwork you want to use for a particular design,
                download it, and tell your designer to use this in their design. This ensures that the design isn’t
                trademarked and that it can be used for commercial purposes!</p>
            <h2>What CAN’T the designs be used for?</h2>
            <p>You obviously can’t resell or redistribute the artwork. You also can’t use the artwork to make
                offensive, unlawful, defamatory, or pornographic material. Which shouldn’t be a problem for any of
                you, because Amazon doesn’t allow those types of shirts to sell, either.</p>

    <div class="home-section default-section Flaticon" style="display: none;">
        <div class="Flaticon-page">
            <h1>An Introduction to Beautiful Flat Icons Design</h1>
            <p>Flat Design is one of the newest approaches in web
                design, aiming for simplicity and powerful visual impact and using shapes as patterns and
                backgrounds. Microsoft’s Metro user interface is probably the most popular Flat Design example.</p>
            <p>We already discussed the Flat Design approach in-depth, and we did it for quite some time now. Most
                of you know Designmodo promotes Flat Design with proudness and designers its own framework according
                to the Flat Design principles. Therefore today we took our time to browse around the web and find
                even more flat design examples, only this time we will focus mostly on icons, not on web designs
                as whole.</p>
            <h3>Responsive Icon</h3>
            <p>This icon can be used to mark themes and layouts which are responsive and fit every device perfectly.
                Funny about this is that if you look for more than five seconds at the icon, the background will
                change. Actually, it is not really happening, but your eyes see it that way.</p>
            <h3>Calendar and Night Icon</h3>
            <p>There are two icons here: there is the calendar icon, which in my opinion is the result of some
                amazing work, and a more abstract icon, which could be used for activating a “sleep mode” for
                example. Although the second icon is a bit abstract, the calendar is amazing.</p>

    <div class="home-section default-section Behance" style="display: none;">
        <div class="Behance-page">
            <h2> What Is Behance?</h2>
            <p>Behance is one of the
                many tools that Adobe has to help creators stand out. It’s somewhat like LinkedIn, in the sense that
                you can use it to showcase your professional work and connect with others.</p>
            <p>Creators in several fields can use Behance,
                but it’s especially helpful for visual artists such as designers, photographers, and videographers.
            </p>
            <p>Behance is quite old in social media terms; Adobe launched the service in 2005.</p>
            <h2> What Can You Do on Behance?</h2>
            <p>Behance’s offerings are pretty diverse, and knowing what you can use the service for before signing
                up will help you get the most out of it. Below is a breakdown of the main things you can use this
                Adobe-owned tool for.</p>
            <p>The main reason most creators use Behance is for creating a portfolio. You can publish projects that
                you’ve either completed for clients or for your own enjoyment.</p>
            <p>When you create a new project to share, you can include several elements. These include, but are not
                limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Photos </li>
                <li> Videos </li>
                <li> Audio </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you’ve got an Adobe Lightroom account, you can save time and import visuals directly from there.
                When you create new projects on Behance, you can increase your visibility by adding tags and sharing
                the tools you’ve used.</p>
            <h3>Display NFTs</h3>
            <p>In 2021, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) became increasingly prominent online. If done correctly, you can
                potentially build an additional income stream by selling these.</p>
            <p>On Behance, you can share your NFTs with others. After creating them, all you need to do is connect
                your cryptocurrency wallet with your Adobe account and make the tokens visible to others.</p>
